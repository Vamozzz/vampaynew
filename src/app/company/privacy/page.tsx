          OTHER SCHEMES CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE GRIEVANCE OFFICER HOW WE
          COLLECT INFORMATION Information You Provide to Us : We collect your
          personal information in order to provide and continually improve our
          products and services. Here are the types of personal information we
          collect: Information You Give Us:We receive and store any information
          you provide in relation to VAMPAY Services. You can choose not to
          provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take
          advantage of many of our VAMPAY Services. Automatic Information:We
          automatically collect and store certain types of information about
          your use of VAMPAY Services, including information about your
          interaction with content and services available through VAMPAY
          Services. Like many websites, we use cookies and other unique
          identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web
          browser or device accesses VAMPAY’s Services and other content served
          by or on behalf of VAMPAY on other websites Third-Party Sources &
          Publicly Available Sources:We also work closely with third parties
          (such as business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and
          delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search
          information providers, address update providers, data append
          providers, co-promotion partners and credit reference agencies), and
          may lawfully receive demographic and other personal information about
          you from those third parties, which we may combine with the
          information you have provided to us. For example, we may lawfully
          collect information about you from content on social media platforms
          (e.g., when you choose to log in to our Site through a third-party
          social media platform (e.g., Facebook), subject to your actions and
          settings on those platforms). We do this to better tailor our
          products, services, Sites and communications, and to ensure we are
          providing our customers and visitors with the best browsing
          experiences. We process all data we obtain from such other sources in
          accordance with this Privacy Notice Note that content and information
          that you submit on or through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and
          other third-party platforms may appear on our Sites through feeds or
          interfaces that we have with those platforms. We are not responsible
          for the information, content and/or privacy practices of any such
          third-party platforms or content pulled through them. Site Usage
          Information & Other Information Collected Automatically:As part of the
          standard operation of the Sites, certain information is collected
          automatically about your visits to the Sites or your device accessing
          a Site. Our servers may automatically gather some of this “Site usage
          information” (such as your IP address, and information about your
          browsers, your device, your location, and your shopping, browsing and
          other usage activities). Additionally, if we have your consent, then
          we (and our service providers) may use cookies and other similar
          technologies to collect and track such information (see our Cookies/Ad
          Choices Policy for more details). WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE PERSONAL
          INFORMATION:Information about our customers is an important part of
          our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’
          personal information to others. We share customers’ personal
          information only as described below and with VAMPAY.com and
          subsidiaries controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice
          or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this
          Privacy Notice. Transactions involving Third Parties:We make available
          to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
          parties for use on or through VAMPAY Services. We also offer services
          or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses registered
          on VAMPAY.in, such as merchants providing bill-payment assistance. You
          can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we
          share customers’ personal information related to those transactions
          with that third party. Third-Party Service Providers:We employ other
          companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
          include sending email, removing repetitive information from customer
          lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing
          search results and links, processing payments, scoring, assessing and
          managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
          third-party service providers have access to personal information
          needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
          purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
          accordance with applicable law. Business Transfers:As we continue to
          develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or
          services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one
          of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises
          made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the
          customer consents otherwise). Protection of VAMPAY and Others:We
          release accounts and other personal information when we believe
          release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
          Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
          property, or safety of VAMPAY, our users, or others. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
          fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Other than as set out
          above, you will receive notice when personal information about you
          might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity
          to choose not to share the information. INFORMATION COLLECTED OR
          RECEIVED In the course of providing our Services, we collect or
          receive your personal information in a few different ways. We obtain
          the categories of personal information listed below from the following
          sources: directly from you, for example, from forms you complete or
          during registration; indirectly from you based on your activity and
          interaction with our Services, or from the device or browser you use
          to access the Services; from our vendors and suppliers that help
          provide VAMPAY services you may interact with (such as, for example,
          for payments or customer support), and from our third party
          advertising and marketing partners. Often, you choose what information
          to provide, but sometimes we require certain information to provide
          you the Services. VAMPAY uses the personal information it receives and
          collects in accordance with the purposes described in this policy. You
          can also choose to provide information to a third party via VAMPAY’s
          API. While users of VAMPAY’s API are required to follow VAMPAY’s API
          Terms of Use, including having appropriate privacy and security
          controls, VAMPAY does not have a direct partner relationship with
          these third parties and their processing of information is subject to
          their own privacy policies. You should understand the privacy and
          security practices of any third party before you share information
          with them. Registration, Account Setup, Service Usage:If you create an
          account to take advantage of the full range of services offered on
          VAMPAY, we ask for and record Personal Information such as your name,
          email address and mobile number. We may collect and store your

          account and know your customer ("KYC") documents as per RBI
          regulations and any other information as may be applicable) that the

          through your account settings. You need to provide this information to
          enable us to provide you with the Services. As a VAMPAY seller, if you
          choose to use our payment service ("VAMPAY Payments"), VAMPAY requires
          your full name, business details, identification ID or tax ID, date of
          birth, bank account information, photograph, credit card information,
          and/or other proof of identification in order to verify your identity,

          , VAMPAY requires this information from you in order to provide you
          with the Services (including, to verify ownership of an account, to
          mitigate fraud and abuse, to comply with regulatory obligations, or to
          complete a transaction). VAMPAY may contact individual business owners
          confidentially to request more information about their business or
          items listed through the Services, or may request information from
          buyers to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law. In
          order to use certain products or services on VAMPAY, you may be
          required to complete an application; information that you submit

          will only be used internally by VAMPAY and its service providers,
          unless otherwise specified. Automated Information:VAMPAY automatically
          receives and records information from your browser or your mobile
          device when you visit the Site, use the Apps, or use certain features
          of the Services, such as your IP address or unique device identifier,
          cookies, and data about which pages you visit and how you interact
          with those pages in order to allow us to operate and provide the
          Services. This information is stored in log files and is collected
          automatically. VAMPAY may also receive similar information (like, for
          example, IP addresses and actions taken on the device) provided by a
          connected Internet of Things device such as a voice-activated
          assistant or Smart TV. We may combine this information from your
          browser or your mobile device with other information that we or our
          advertising or marketing partners collect about you, including across
          devices. This information is used to prevent fraud and to keep the
          Services secure, to analyze and understand how the Services work for
          members and visitors, and to provide advertising, including across
          your devices, and a more personalized experience for members and
          visitors. We also automatically collect device-specific information
          when you install, access, or use our Services. This information can
          include information such as the hardware model, operating system
          information, app version, app usage and debugging information, browser
          information, IP address, and device identifiers. Data from VAMPAY
          Vendors and Suppliers: We also receive information from our vendors
          and suppliers about you. This information can include customer service
          interactions, payments information, delivery information, and
          information shared in VAMPAY’s forums. Data from Advertising and
          Marketing Partners:As described below, VAMPAY receives information
          from our advertising and marketing partners about you. This
          information can include attribution information via cookies and UTM
          tags in URLs to determine where a visit to VAMPAY comes from,
          responses to marketing emails and advertisements, responses to offers,
          and audience information from partners who you have given consent to
          share that information with us. Location Information:We collect
          information about your use of the Services for advertising, for
          analytics, to serve content, and to protect the Services. This can
          include your IP address, browser information (including referrers),
          device information (such as iOS IDFA, IDFV for limited non-advertising
          purposes, Android AAID, and, when enabled by you, location information
          provided by your device). You can choose to publish your location when
          you sell on VAMPAY. We obtain location information you provide in your
          profile or your IP address. With your consent, we may also determine
          location by using other information from your device, such as precise
          location information from GPS or information about wireless networks
          or cell towers near your mobile device. We use and store information
          about your location to provide features and to improve and customise
          the Services, for example, for VAMPAY’s internal analytics and
          performance monitoring; localisation, regional requirements, and
          policies for the Services; for local content, search results, and
          recommendations; for delivery and mapping services; and (using
          non-precise location information) marketing. If you have consented to
          share your precise device location details but would no longer like to
          continue sharing that information with us, you may revoke your consent
          to the sharing of that information through the settings on the Apps or
          on your mobile device. Certain non-precise location services, such as
          for security and localised policies based on your IP address or
          submitted address, are critical for the Site to function. We will only
          share your geolocation details with third parties (like our mapping,
          payments, or, to the extent applicable, advertising providers) in
          order to provide you with the Services. You may also choose to enable
          the Apps to access your mobile device’s camera to upload photographs
          to VAMPAY. Analytics Information:We use data analytics software to
          ensure Site and App functionality and to improve the Services. This
          software records information such as how often you use the website,
          what happens within the website, aggregated usage, performance data,
          app errors and debugging information, and where the website was
          downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the
          analytics software to any personally identifiable information that you
          submit within the mobile application. Non-Member Information:VAMPAY
          receives or obtains information (for example, an email address or IP
          address) about a person who is not yet a registered VAMPAY member (a
          “non-member”) in connection with certain VAMPAY features, such as when
          a non-member chooses to subscribe to an VAMPAY newsletter, a member
          invites a non-member to visit the Site, a member uploads non-member
          information using the contact uploader feature, a non-member engages
          in a transaction. Non-member information is used only for the purposes
          disclosed when it was submitted to VAMPAY, for purposes necessary to
          the functioning of VAMPAY's Services or where VAMPAY has a legitimate
          interest. Pattern by VAMPAY:We also collect certain information from
          both members and non-members who visit websites hosted by us. This
          information may include your IP address or unique device identifier,
          and cookies and data from the pages you visit. PHISHING, SPOOFING &
          OTHER SCHEMES It has become increasingly common for hackers,
          cyber-criminals and other unauthorized individuals to send emails and
          other communications to consumers purporting to represent a legitimate
          company, such as a bank or an online retailer, and requesting through
          those communications that the consumer provide personal, often
          sensitive, information. Sometimes, the domain name of the sender’s
          email address, or the domain name of the website requesting such
          information, may appear to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted
          company. If you receive a request to provide information (including
          your online account password, or any payment information) via email or
          to a website or individual that does not seem to be affiliated with
          the Sites or VAMPAY, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please
          do not respond or disclose your information. VAMPAY will never send
          you an email requesting that you verify any credit card information,
          financial information or other personal information. Please
          immediately report any such communication. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY
          NOTICE We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time and the
          amended notice will be posted to the Sites. Under certain
          circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material
          adverse changes to this Privacy Notice), we may also elect to notify
          you through additional means, such as posting a notice on the home
          page(s) of the Sites or contacting you via email. Complaints and
          Grievance Redressal If you contact us to provide feedback, register a
          complaint, or ask a question, we will record any Personal Information
          and other content that you provide in your communication so that we
          can effectively respond to your communication. Any complaints or
          concerns in relation to your Personal Information or content of this
          Website or any dispute or breach of confidentiality or any proprietary
          rights of User during use of the Website or any intellectual property
