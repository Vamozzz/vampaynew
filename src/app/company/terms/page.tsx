          Provider will impose additional Reserve Deposit Amounts, either
          temporarily or permanently, which are more restrictive than limits

          out of or relating to this Agreement or Service provided in connection
          with this Agreement by binding arbitration in accordance with the

          such dispute, controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an
          individual basis and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with
          any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be
          conducted in Mumbai, India and judgment on the arbitration award may
          be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. All
          administrative fees and expenses of an arbitration will be divided

          the expense of its own lawyers and preparation. The language of
          Arbitration shall be English. 11. Governing Law and Forum for Disputes

          giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. 12. Severability
          If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void,
          invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then that provision will be
          limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent
          required, and the remaining provisions will remain valid and
          enforceable. 13. Assignment This Agreement, and any rights granted
          hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You without our prior
          written consent which may be withheld in our sole discretion, but may
          be assigned by us without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be
          made in violation of this provision shall be void and of no effect.
